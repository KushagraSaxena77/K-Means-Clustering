# K-Means Clustering

## Introduction
K-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into distinct clusters. This repository provides an implementation of the K-Means algorithm along with example use cases and instructions on how to use the code.

## Features
- Implementation of the K-Means algorithm
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Visualization of clustering results
- Example use cases and datasets

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here are the basic steps to run the K-Means Clustering project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KushagraSaxena77/K-Means-Clustering.git
   cd K-Means-Clustering
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Data
The dataset used for this project should be placed in the `data` directory. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and contains the necessary features for clustering.


## Visualization
To visualize the clustering results, you can use the `visualize.py` script provided in the repository. Run the following command to visualize the results:

```bash
python visualize.py
```
